# KALMAN FILTERING 
Kalman filtering, named after Rudolf E. Kalman, is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, which contain statistical noise and other inaccuracies, to produce estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement.





## How does it work
The Kalman filter operates in two main phases: Prediction and Update.

1. Prediction Phase: The filter predicts the next state of the system based on the current state and a state transition model.

2. Update Phase: When a new measurement is taken, the filter updates its prediction using a weighted average, giving more weight to estimates with greater certainty.


## Difference between Kalman and Guassian Filters
*Kalman Filter* is used for estimating the state of a linear dynamic system based on noisy measurements. It's more applicable in control systems, robotics, and navigation.

*Gaussian Filter* is primarily used in image processing to reduce noise and detail in an image, by applying a Gaussian function to smooth the image.

## Applications of Kalman Filters

1. Navigation Systems
Aircraft and Spacecraft: Kalman filters are crucial in the avionics of modern aircraft and spacecraft for real-time estimation of position, velocity, and attitude based on sensor data like GPS and inertial measurement units (IMUs).

Maritime Navigation: Used in ship and submarine navigation systems to integrate data from sonar, radar, and inertial navigation systems.

2. Robotics
Localization and Mapping: Employed in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms to help robots and autonomous vehicles determine their position in an unknown environment.

Sensor Fusion: Combines data from various sensors like LIDAR, GPS, and IMUs to provide a reliable estimate of a robot's state.

3. Finance and Economics
Time Series Analysis: Utilized for forecasting economic indicators, stock prices, and interest rates by modeling the underlying state of the economic system.

Risk Management: Helps in estimating the volatility of assets and optimizing investment portfolios.

4. Signal Processing
Noise Reduction: Filters out noise from signals in various applications such as telecommunications, audio processing, and biomedical engineering (e.g., ECG signal filtering).

Tracking and Detection: Used in radar and sonar systems for tracking objects by filtering noisy position measurements.

5. Control Systems
Automotive Systems: Employed in adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping systems, and other advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) to provide accurate estimates of vehicle states.

Industrial Automation: Used in control loops for processes like temperature control, pressure regulation, and robotic arm positioning.

6. Weather Forecasting
Data Assimilation: Integrates observational data into weather models to improve the accuracy of weather predictions.

7. Health and Medicine
Medical Imaging: Enhances the quality of images in medical diagnostics by filtering out noise.

Wearable Devices: Used in fitness trackers and smartwatches to estimate parameters like heart rate and activity levels based on sensor data.
